# Firewatch

A geographic information system that evaluates a fire hazard of a map area based on the Nesterov's scale and uses the [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) library for rendering the map.

The system was developed as a graduate qualification work at Sholem Aleichem Amur State University in 2019.
